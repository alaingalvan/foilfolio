```bash
npm i foilfolio -S
```
A sparkly shiny portfolio indexing system. Convert blog posts, art, music, etc. into database entries that you can traverse and search through.

## Use Case

Say you want to showcase your portfolio, which is very heterogenous. It's filled with all sorts of different categories of work since you're `reddit.com/r/verysmart` and are the next Einstein-Da Vinci amalgamation.

Foilfolio makes it so that you can quickly index those works into searchable entries in a MongoDB database, and packages them up into JavaScript modules that can be loaded dynamically by a **SPA** (Single Page App).

This is useful if say, you're coupling portfolio entries with React views, a simple route could give a unique application dynamically loaded by your main app. ðŸ¤¯
